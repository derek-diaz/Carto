# Zenoh Docker with Plugins

This folder runs a local Zenoh router with the Remote API plugin enabled,
so Carto can connect without needing you to install Zenoh on your machine.

You can use this as a starter point for Zenoh in your docker infrastructure!

## Run

From the repo root:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up --build
